# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this Linux learning repo!

## How to contribute
- Fix typos or clarify explanations.
- Add or improve labs (use the Lab Template).
- Add tests for scripts with bats-core.
- Suggest alternative approaches with pros/cons.

## Style (shell & docs)
- Shell: bash with `set -euo pipefail`, quote all variables, pass ShellCheck.
- Prefer long options (`--recursive`) and explicit paths.
- Docs: concise sections; examples first; fenced code blocks with language tags.

## PR checklist
- [ ] Small, focused change
- [ ] Updated docs/lab README
- [ ] `shellcheck` clean (no warnings)
- [ ] Tests added/updated (if scripts)
