## üí° Key Takeaways  

- Linux is everywhere: phones, routers, TVs, supercomputers, and cloud servers.  
- The operating system is the manager between hardware and software.  
- Linux is technically the **kernel**, but distributions add user tools.  
- Its history ties back to UNIX, the GNU project, and open-source licensing.  
- Differences between Unix, Linux, and Windows shape professional choices.  
- Distributions serve different audiences: beginners, enterprises, power users, and specialists.  
- Linux powers industries from NASA to Wall Street to Hollywood.  
- Hands-on comparison with Windows highlights Linux‚Äôs automation-first design.

## üöÄ Next Steps  

With Module 1 complete, you‚Äôre ready to move into **Module 2: Virtual Lab Setup**.  
This module will guide you through creating a safe Linux learning environment inside **VirtualBox**, where you can practice without risk to your main computer.  

You‚Äôll learn how to:  
- Install and configure VirtualBox  
- Create and run your first Linux virtual machine  
- Enhance it with Guest Additions for better usability  
- Use snapshots to experiment safely  

By the end of Module 2, you‚Äôll have a working Linux VM ‚Äî your personal playground for all future hands-on learning.
