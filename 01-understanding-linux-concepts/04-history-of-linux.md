# Module 1: Understanding Linux Concepts

## Chapter 4: History of Linux

### 🖥️ Introduction
Understanding where Linux came from helps explain why it’s fast, reliable, and everywhere. This chapter traces Linux’s roots in UNIX, the free-software movement, and the global collaboration that turned a hobby kernel into the backbone of modern computing.

### 📚 What You’ll Learn
- How UNIX set the blueprint Linux follows  
- The GNU Project’s role and what it was missing  
- Key milestones from Linux’s 1991 debut to today  

## 1️⃣ The Predecessor: UNIX
UNIX began at **AT&T Bell Labs** in the **late 1960s / early 1970s** (led by **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie**). Two reasons it mattered:

- A clean design: multi-user, hierarchical files, processes, pipes.  
- **Rewritten in C (1973):** suddenly UNIX could be moved to many machines.  

UNIX itself was largely **proprietary**, with multiple commercial flavors (e.g., System V, vendors’ BSD-derived systems). Its ideas shaped later standards (like **POSIX**) and inspired Linux.

## 2️⃣ The GNU Project: Toward Free Software
In **1983**, **Richard Stallman** launched **GNU** (“GNU’s Not UNIX”) to build a **free UNIX-like OS**. GNU delivered major pieces—**GCC** (compiler), **Bash** (shell), and core utilities—but its own kernel, **Hurd**, never reached production readiness. The last missing piece was a working kernel.

## 3️⃣ The Birth of Linux (1991)
In **1991**, **Linus Torvalds**, a student in Finland, started a free **kernel** as a personal project. On **August 25, 1991**, he announced it on the MINIX newsgroup (“just a hobby…”).

- **0.01 (Sept 1991):** first code drop; not end-user ready.  
- **0.02 (Oct 1991):** could run **GNU Bash** and **GCC**, making the system usable for developers.  
- **1992:** Linux was **relicensed under GPLv2**, allowing anyone to use, modify, and share improvements—crucial for rapid growth.  

Together, the **Linux kernel** + **GNU userland** formed a complete, free, UNIX-like system (often called **Linux**, sometimes **GNU/Linux**).

## 4️⃣ Growth and Evolution
- **1993:** Early distros like **Slackware** and **Debian** simplify installation.  
- **1994:** **Linux 1.0** ships—a landmark “stable” kernel release.  
- **Late 1990s:** Companies like **Red Hat** and **SUSE** offer supported distributions, boosting enterprise credibility.  
- **2005:** Linus creates **Git** to manage the fast-moving kernel—later adopted across the software world.  
- **2007/2008:** **Android** (built on the Linux kernel) is announced (2007) and ships on the first phone (2008), bringing Linux to billions of devices.  
- **2000s onward:** Linux dominates servers, powers most cloud platforms, and becomes the default for supercomputing.

## 5️⃣ Linux Today: A Global Powerhouse
Linux runs on:
- **Phones & tablets (Android)**  
- **Desktops & laptops** (especially for developers)  
- **Servers & cloud** (web, databases, containers, Kubernetes)  
- **Mainframes & supercomputers** (scale and reliability)  
- **Embedded/IoT** (routers, TVs, cars, medical devices)

## 6️⃣ Why Open Source Won Here
Linux thrives on **open collaboration**:
- The **GPLv2** license ensures improvements remain shareable.  
- A global maintainer network reviews and merges code at high velocity.  
- The **Linux Foundation** (formed 2007) coordinates funding, standards, and key projects around the kernel ecosystem.  

Open development didn’t just shape Linux—it reshaped the entire industry.

## ✅ Conclusion
Linux grew from a student’s kernel into a planetary platform by combining UNIX design, GNU tools, a share-alike license, and a worldwide community. That mix explains why Linux scales from tiny sensors to the fastest supercomputers.
