# Module 1: Understanding Linux Concepts

## Chapter 1: How We Use Linux Every Day

### 🖥️ Introduction

Ever wondered what keeps your smart devices running so smoothly? Behind the scenes, a powerful operating system called **Linux** powers many of the technologies you use every day. Born in **1991** as a personal project by Linus Torvalds, Linux has grown into the backbone of modern computing. Let’s take a look at how Linux quietly works its magic in your life!

### 📚 What Will You Learn?

- **Real-world examples** of Linux in action  
- How Linux makes both personal and professional technology more reliable

## 1️⃣ Linux in Everyday Devices

Linux is secure, flexible, and reliable. It's the foundation for:

- **Smart TVs**  
  _Many platforms (like Tizen and webOS) are Linux-based, making streaming and apps work smoothly._

- **Android Smartphones**  
  _Android is built on the **Linux kernel** (with Android-specific patches)._

- **Tablets & eReaders**  
  _Many e-readers, including the Amazon Kindle, use Linux-based firmware for performance and battery life._

- **Wi-Fi Routers**  
  _A lot of home routers run embedded **Linux** under the hood (often **OpenWrt** with **BusyBox**) to keep your network fast and secure._

## 2️⃣ Linux on the Move: Cars, Planes, and More

Transport companies and car makers rely on Linux for smart technology:

- **In-Flight Entertainment (IFE)**  
  _Many airline entertainment systems use Linux to manage movies, music, and seat-back apps._

- **Cars & Autonomy**  
  _Automakers widely use Linux for **infotainment** dashboards. Autonomous driving stacks commonly develop on Linux (often with **ROS**: the Robot Operating System). Safety-critical control may pair Linux with a dedicated real-time OS._

## 3️⃣ Linux in the Cloud and the Internet

Linux is the top choice for web services and cloud computing because it’s stable and high-performing:

- **Web Servers**  
  _A large share of the web runs on **Linux**; popular servers like **Nginx** and **Apache** commonly run on Linux._

- **Cloud Computing**  
  _AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure all run massive fleets of Linux and offer Linux as a first-class option for developers._

## 4️⃣ Using Linux for Fixing and Recovering Systems

Linux often comes to the rescue when computers crash or files are lost:

- **Recovery Disks**  
  _Many emergency tools for Windows boot into small Linux systems to help diagnose problems._

- **Backup & Rescue Tools**  
  _Utilities like **Clonezilla** and **SystemRescue** are Linux-based and can help you back up or recover files._

## 5️⃣ Linux in Your Home Appliances

As our homes become smarter, Linux powers more gadgets:

- **Smart Appliances**  
  _Fridges, ovens, and washing machines with touchscreens often run Linux._

- **Home Automation**  
  _Devices controlling lights, cameras, or temperature commonly use Linux for reliability and connectivity._

### 💻 Related Project

To deepen my understanding, I created a hands-on project where I explored and documented Linux in the devices I use every day:  
[Project 01: Linux Around Me](https://github.com/anup-moitra/foundational-linux-training/blob/main/Projects/01-linux-around-me.md)

> 🔎 **Try this:** Open your router’s admin page and look for an “Open-source licenses” or “GPL” section: many vendors list **Linux** and **BusyBox** there.

For example, when I logged into my Wi-Fi router’s admin page, I discovered it runs a lightweight Linux system (with BusyBox). That little discovery made Linux feel less abstract and more like something quietly running in my own home.

### 🏁 Conclusion

From smartphones and smart homes to cloud computing and car navigation, **Linux** works quietly behind the scenes. Its power, stability, and flexibility make it the heart of modern technology.
