# **Module 1: Virtual Lab Setup**  

## **Chapter 2: Creating and Configuring a Virtual Machine**  

### **📝 Introduction**  
In this chapter, we will guide you through the process of creating and configuring a virtual machine (VM) using **VirtualBox**. This is a crucial step in preparing for the next chapter, where we’ll demonstrate how to download, install, and set up **CentOS Stream 9**, a popular Linux distribution, within this virtual environment.

### **👇 Step-by-Step Instructions**  

#### **🚀 1. Launch VirtualBox**  
- Start by opening **VirtualBox** from your system's application menu or desktop shortcut.  

#### **🖥️ 2. Create a New Virtual Machine**  
1. Click the **“New”** button to initiate the virtual machine setup wizard.  
2. Assign a name to the VM, e.g., **"CentOS Stream 9"**. This name is used within **VirtualBox** and is separate from the hostname, which will be configured during OS installation.  
3. Choose the folder for VM files (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\VirtualBox VMs`). Ensure the location has enough space.  
4. Leave the **ISO image** field blank for now; we’ll configure it during OS installation in the next chapter.  
5. Select **Linux** as the type and set the version to **Red Hat (64-bit)** to match CentOS Stream 9 (64-bit).  
6. Skip the **Unattended Installation** option to allow manual OS installation with customization.  
7. Configure **Hardware Settings**:  
   - Allocate at least **2 GB (2048 MB)** of RAM (adjust based on system resources).  
   - Keep the default **1 CPU core** or increase it later for better performance.  
8. Configure **Storage Settings**:  
   - Create a **new virtual hard disk** or select an existing one.  
   - Choose **VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)** as the disk type.  
   - Decide between **dynamically allocated** or **fixed size**.  
   - Set the hard disk size to **at least 20 GB** for the OS and additional software.

### **🌐 Configuring Network Settings**  

1. After the VM is created, select it and click on the **“Settings”** button.  
2. Navigate to the **Network** tab:  
   - Ensure the network adapter is enabled.  
   - By default, it’s set to **NAT**, providing basic network access.  
   - For enhanced connectivity, change it to **Bridged Adapter**, placing the VM on the same network as your host machine.  
3. Click **OK** to save the settings.
