# Project 03: Exploring Linux Distributions

## 📝 Objective  

As part of my foundational Linux learning journey, I explored the concept of **Linux distributions (distros)** and identified how they differ. This project connects to **Chapter 3: What Is Linux?** and helps link theory to real-world examples.  

**Related reading:** [Chapter 3: What Is Linux?](https://github.com/anup-moitra/foundational-linux-training/blob/main/01-understanding-linux-concepts/03-what%20is-linux.md)  

## 📋 Tasks I Performed  

- Checked my own system’s distribution with:  
  ```bash
  cat /etc/os-release
  ```  
- Researched three major Linux distributions on [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/).  
- Compared their intended use cases and package managers.  

## 📸 Proof: My Images and Screenshots  

Screenshots to be stored under `images/` in the project directory:  

1. Output of `cat /etc/os-release` (showing my current distro).  
2. Notes or screenshots from DistroWatch showing information about three popular distros (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch).  

## 🔗 Research Highlights  

- **Ubuntu (Debian-based):** Uses `apt`. Known for ease of use and large community.  
- **Fedora (RHEL-based):** Uses `dnf`. Cutting-edge features, upstream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  
- **Arch Linux:** Uses `pacman`. Minimalist, rolling release, very customizable.  

Reference: [DistroWatch Linux Distributions](https://distrowatch.com/)  

## 💡 What I Learned  

- Linux is not one single operating system but a family of **distributions**.  
- Each distro combines the same Linux kernel with different tools, package managers, and philosophies.  
- My own system is part of the **CentOS Stream 9 / RHEL family**, which focuses on stability.  
- Choosing the right distro depends on whether you want stability, cutting-edge features, or full control.  

## 📁 My Process  

1. Identified my own distribution using `cat /etc/os-release`.  
2. Researched distros on DistroWatch.  
3. Collected screenshots of findings.  
4. Compared package managers and use cases.  
5. Summarized observations and reflections here.
