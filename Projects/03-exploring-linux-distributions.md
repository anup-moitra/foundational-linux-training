# Project 03: Exploring Linux Distributions

## 📝 Objective  

To deepen my understanding of Linux, I compared different distributions and how they are designed for different use cases. This project connects to **Chapter 3: What Is Linux?** and helps link theory to real-world examples.  

**Related reading:** [Chapter 3: What Is Linux?](../01-understanding-linux-concepts/03-what-is-linux.md)  

## 📋 Tasks I Performed  

- Checked my own system distribution with:  
  ```bash
  cat /etc/os-release
  ```  
- Researched three major Linux distributions on [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/)  
- Compared their intended use cases, package managers, and philosophies  

## 📸 Proof: My Images and Screenshots  

Screenshots are stored under the `images/` folder in the project directory.  

1. Output of `cat /etc/os-release`

   *Figure 1: Output confirming the system is running CentOS Stream 9, which is part of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux family.*  

2. Notes or screenshots from DistroWatch showing information about three popular Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux).  
   *Figure 2: Research notes highlighting package managers and philosophies of major distributions.*  

## 🔗 Research Highlights  

- **Ubuntu (Debian based):** Uses `apt`. Known for long term support releases, ease of use, and large community.  
- **Fedora (Red Hat based):** Uses `dnf`. Provides cutting edge features and serves as the upstream source for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  
- **Arch Linux:** Uses `pacman`. Minimalist, rolling release, designed for full customization and user control.

## 💡 What I Learned  

- Linux is not one single operating system but a family of distributions built on the same kernel  
- Each distribution combines the kernel with different tools, package managers, and philosophies  
- My own system is part of the CentOS Stream 9 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux family, which emphasizes stability and enterprise use  
- Choosing the right distribution depends on your goals: stability, cutting edge features, or full customization  
- Understanding distributions is important for career growth and often appears in interviews for IT and system administration roles  

## 📁 My Process  

1. Identified my own distribution using `cat /etc/os-release`  
2. Researched distributions on DistroWatch  
3. Collected screenshots of findings  
4. Compared package managers, philosophies, and use cases  
5. Summarized observations and reflections here  

### 🏁 Conclusion  

This project showed me that Linux is not a single product but an ecosystem of distributions, each tailored for different needs. Understanding their differences gave me confidence in choosing the right environment for learning, enterprise practice, or advanced customization.  

> 💡 **Next Up:**  
> I will research the history of Linux to understand how it grew from a student project into a global platform.
