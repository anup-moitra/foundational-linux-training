# Project 03: Exploring Linux Remote Access

## üìù Objective

To reinforce our skills with real-world Linux system access, we connected to our Linux virtual machine using multiple SSH clients and set up key-based authentication. This project emphasizes comparing tools, documenting platform-specific differences, and developing more secure authentication practices. All tasks were carried out by us, step by step.

## üìã Tasks & Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect from Multiple Platforms

We used all available methods to connect to our Linux VM:

- **PuTTY on Windows**
- **Built-in SSH client (Command Prompt or PowerShell) on Windows**
- **Terminal on macOS**
- **Terminal on Linux**

For each method:

- We logged in using our username and password.
- A screenshot or short note was captured to confirm the successful login prompt.
- Any unique authentication prompts, error messages, or additional steps were noted.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting & Notes

We recorded every issue faced during connection attempts, such as:

- Connection refused  
- Incorrect port or IP  
- Authentication failure  

Each problem was resolved by actions such as adjusting firewall rules, correcting usernames, or enabling SSH on the server. These resolutions were documented thoroughly.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up SSH Key-Based Authentication

We set up passwordless login using SSH keys:

1. We generated an SSH key pair on the client system (Windows/macOS/Linux):

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "our_email@example.com"
   ```

2. We copied the public key to the Linux VM:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id <username>@<IP_address>
   ```

   *If `ssh-copy-id` was not available, we manually appended the key using:*

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <username>@<IP_address> "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```

3. We attempted to log in again, this time without a password prompt.
4. All commands used and the final outcome were recorded. Key-based login was verified to work as expected.

## üîç Reporting Template

For each client platform (PuTTY, built-in Windows SSH, macOS Terminal, Linux Terminal), we recorded the following:

- **SSH command or method used**
- **Screenshot or CLI output**
- **Unique prompts, setup steps, or issues encountered**
- **How each issue was resolved**

For SSH key-based authentication, we documented:

- **Commands and tools used for key generation**
- **How the key was transferred to the VM**
- **Description of the first key-based login**
- **Whether passwordless login was successful**
- **Troubleshooting steps or lessons learned**

## üèÅ Conclusion

By completing this project, we practiced and compared different SSH tools, overcame real connection obstacles, and significantly improved our login security using SSH keys. These steps prepared us for real-world server environments and helped build a strong foundation for troubleshooting and documenting Linux remote access.
