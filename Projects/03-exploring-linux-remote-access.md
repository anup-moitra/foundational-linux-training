# Project 03: Exploring Linux Remote Access

## üìù Objective

To reinforce our skills with real-world Linux system access, we connected to our Linux virtual machine using multiple SSH clients and set up key-based authentication. This project emphasizes comparing tools, documenting platform-specific differences, and developing more secure authentication practices. All tasks were carried out by us, step by step.

## üìã Tasks & Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect from Multiple Platforms

We used all available methods to connect to our Linux VM:

- **PuTTY on Windows**
- **Built-in SSH client (Command Prompt or PowerShell) on Windows**
- **Terminal on macOS**
- **Terminal on Linux**

For each method:

- We logged in using our username and password.
- A screenshot or short note was captured to confirm the successful login prompt.
- Any unique authentication prompts, error messages, or additional steps were noted.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting & Notes

We recorded every issue faced during connection attempts, such as:

- Connection refused  
- Incorrect port or IP  
- Authentication failure  

Each problem was resolved by actions such as adjusting firewall rules, correcting usernames, or enabling SSH on the server. These resolutions were documented thoroughly.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up SSH Key-Based Authentication

We set up passwordless login using SSH keys:

1. We generated an SSH key pair on the client system (Windows/macOS/Linux):

   To generate a key pair, run: 
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "our_email@example.com"
   ```

2. We copied the public key to the Linux VM:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id <username>@<IP_address>
   ```

   *If `ssh-copy-id` was not available, we manually appended the key using:*

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <username>@<IP_address> "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```

3. We attempted to log in again, this time without a password prompt.
4. All commands used and the final outcome were recorded. Key-based login was verified to work as expected.

## üîç Reporting Template

For each client platform (PuTTY, built-in Windows SSH, macOS Terminal, Linux Terminal), we recorded the following:

- **SSH command or method used**
- **Screenshot or CLI output**
- **Unique prompts, setup steps, or issues encountered**
- **How each issue was resolved**

For SSH key-based authentication, we documented:

- **Commands and tools used for key generation**
- **How the key was transferred to the VM**
- **Description of the first key-based login**
- **Whether passwordless login was successful**
- **Troubleshooting steps or lessons learned**

## üèÅ Conclusion

By completing this project, we practiced and compared different SSH tools, overcame real connection obstacles, and significantly improved our login security using SSH keys. Through hands-on experience, we learned why SSH key-based authentication is more secure and reliable than passwords for routine server administration. These steps prepared us for real-world server environments and helped build a strong foundation for troubleshooting and documenting Linux remote access.
