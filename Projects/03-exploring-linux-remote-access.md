# Project 03: Exploring Linux Remote Access

## üìù Objective

To reinforce our skills with real-world Linux system access, we will connect to our Linux virtual machine using multiple SSH clients and set up key-based authentication. This project emphasizes comparing tools, documenting platform-specific differences, and developing more secure authentication practices.

## üìã Tasks & Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect from Multiple Platforms

- Use all available methods to connect to your Linux VM:
  - **PuTTY on Windows**
  - **Built-in SSH client (Command Prompt or PowerShell) on Windows**
  - **Terminal on macOS**
  - **Terminal on Linux**

For each method:
- Log in with your username and password.
- Take a screenshot or write a short note about the successful login prompt.
- Note any unique authentication prompts, error messages, or additional steps required.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting & Notes

- Record any issues (e.g., connection refused, wrong port, authentication failed).
- Document how you resolved each issue (for example, adjusting firewall rules, correcting usernames, enabling SSH on the server).
