# Project 04: Linux Timeline Research  

## üìù Objective  

In this project, I traced Linux history by researching key milestones and why they mattered. This project supports **Chapter 4: History of Linux** by showing how Linux grew from a student project into today‚Äôs global platform.  

**Related reading:** [Chapter 4: History of Linux](../01-understanding-linux-concepts/04-history-of-linux.md)  

## üìã Tasks I Performed  

- Researched important milestones in Linux history  
- Built a simple timeline of at least five events  
- Added short notes on why each milestone mattered  

## üì∏ Proof: My Images and Screenshots  

Below are the images and screenshots stored under the `images/` folder in the project directory.

## üîó Research Highlights  

| **Year / Period** | **Milestone** |  
|------------------:|:--------------|  
| 1970s | **UNIX origins** ‚Äì Multi-user design and rewritten in C for portability |  
| 1983 | **GNU Project** ‚Äì Free software tools such as GCC, Bash, and coreutils |  
| 1991 | **Linux kernel** ‚Äì Linus Torvalds begins his personal project |  
| 1992 | **GPLv2 license** ‚Äì Licensing enables global collaboration |  
| 1993 | **Debian and Slackware** ‚Äì Early distributions that helped adoption |  
| 1994 | **Linux 1.0 release** ‚Äì First stable kernel with about 176,000 lines of code |  
| 2005 | **Git created** ‚Äì Distributed version control that scaled kernel development |  
| 2007 | **Linux Foundation formed** ‚Äì Coordinated development and industry support |  
| 2008 | **Android phone ships** ‚Äì Linux reaches billions of users |  

## üí° What I Learned  

- Linux success combines UNIX design principles, GNU tools, and open licensing  
- Key milestones such as GPL licensing and the creation of Git shaped not only Linux but also the broader software industry  
- Building this timeline made me appreciate the culture of collaboration and how open source principles turned Linux into a global standard  
- These historical insights are often discussed in interviews, especially around open source development and version control systems such as Git  

## üìÅ My Process  

1. Reviewed Chapter 4 content  
2. Collected dates and milestones from trusted sources  
3. Created a timeline with at least five key events  
4. Added notes explaining why each milestone mattered  
5. Summarized findings and reflections here  

### üèÅ Conclusion  

By building this timeline, I saw how design ideas, licensing, and collaboration intersected to make Linux the foundation of modern computing. It also showed me how a community driven project could scale into global infrastructure.  

> üí° **Next Up:**  
> I will explore the differences between Unix and Linux to better understand their relationship and terminology.
