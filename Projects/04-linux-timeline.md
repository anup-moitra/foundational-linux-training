# Project 04: Linux Timeline Research

## 📝 Objective  

As part of my foundational Linux learning journey, I researched the history of Linux to connect theory with key milestones. This project supports **Chapter 4: History of Linux** by encouraging me to trace how Linux grew from a student project into today’s global platform.  

**Related reading:** [Chapter 4: History of Linux](https://github.com/anup-moitra/foundational-linux-training/blob/main/01-understanding-linux-concepts/04-history-of-linux.md)  

## 📋 Tasks I Performed  

- Researched important milestones in Linux history.  
- Built a simple timeline of at least five events.  
- Added short notes on why each milestone mattered.  

## 📸 Proof: My Images and Screenshots  

Screenshots or notes to be stored under `images/` in the project directory:  


1. Timeline diagram

   *Infographic summarizing key milestones from UNIX to Android.*  


2. Notes or screenshots from official sources (kernel.org, GNU, Linux Foundation).  


## 🔗 Research Highlights  

- **1970s: UNIX origins** — multi-user design, rewritten in C.  
- **1983: GNU Project** — free software tools (GCC, Bash, coreutils).  
- **1991: Linux kernel** — Linus Torvalds begins his hobby project.  
- **1992: GPLv2 license** — enabled global collaboration.  
- **1993: Debian and Slackware** — early distributions.  
- **1994: Linux 1.0 release** — first stable kernel.  
- **2005: Git created** — revolutionized software collaboration.  
- **2007: Linux Foundation formed** — coordinated development and industry support.  
- **2008: Android phone ships** — Linux reaches billions of users.  

## 💡 What I Learned  

- Linux’s success combined **UNIX design principles, GNU tools, and open licensing**.  
- Key milestones (like GPL licensing and the creation of Git) shaped not only Linux but the broader software industry.  
- Understanding Linux history helps explain its culture of collaboration and why open source is so powerful.  

## 📁 My Process  

1. Reviewed Chapter 4 content.  
2. Collected dates and milestones from trusted sources.  
3. Created a timeline with at least five key events.  
4. Added notes explaining each milestone.  
5. Summarized findings and reflections here.
