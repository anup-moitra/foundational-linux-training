# Project 04: Linux Timeline Research  

## 📝 Objective  

Here I traced Linux’s history by researching key milestones and why they mattered. This project supports **Chapter 4: History of Linux** by tracing how Linux grew from a student project into today’s global platform.  

**Related reading:** [Chapter 4: History of Linux](https://github.com/anup-moitra/foundational-linux-training/blob/main/01-understanding-linux-concepts/04-history-of-linux.md)  

## 📋 Tasks I Performed  

Here are the activities I completed for this project:  

- Researched important milestones in Linux history.  
- Built a simple timeline of at least five events.  
- Added short notes on why each milestone mattered.

## 🔗 Research Highlights  

| **Year / Period** | **Milestone** |  
|------------------:|:--------------|  
| 1970s | **UNIX origins** – Multi-user design and rewritten in C for portability. |  
| 1983 | **GNU Project** – Free software tools such as GCC, Bash, and coreutils. |  
| 1991 | **Linux kernel** – Linus Torvalds begins his hobby project. |  
| 1992 | **GPLv2 license** – Licensing enables global collaboration. |  
| 1993 | **Debian and Slackware** – Early distributions that helped adoption. |  
| 1994 | **Linux 1.0 release** – First stable kernel. |  
| 2005 | **Git created** – Distributed version control that scaled kernel work. |  
| 2007 | **Linux Foundation formed** – Coordinated development and industry support. |  
| 2008 | **Android phone ships** – Linux reaches billions of users. |  

## 💡 What I Learned  

Linux success combines **UNIX design principles, GNU tools, and open licensing**.  
Key milestones such as GPL licensing and the creation of Git shaped not only Linux but the broader software industry.  
Understanding Linux history explains the culture of collaboration and why open source is powerful.  

## 📁 My Process  

1. I reviewed Chapter 4 content.  
2. I collected dates and milestones from trusted sources.  
3. I created a timeline with at least five key events.  
4. I added notes explaining each milestone.  
5. I summarized findings and reflections here.
