# Project 01: Linux Around Me

## 📝 Objective

As part of my foundational Linux learning journey, I explored and documented where Linux is present in my daily life. This project captures my investigation and observations for **Chapter 1: How We Use Linux Every Day**, connecting course concepts to real-world examples I could find around me.

## 📋 Devices & Services I Identified

Here are the devices and services I personally use that rely on Linux:

- **Phone:** Android smartphone – runs the Linux kernel
- **Home Wi-Fi Router:** [Insert Brand/Model] – uses [OpenWRT/Linux-based firmware if applicable]
- **Smart TV:** [Insert Brand/Model] – powered by Linux-based OS
- **Tablet or eReader:** [Insert Device] – Linux (for example, Kindle eReader)
- **Cloud Apps I rely on:** YouTube, Gmail, Dropbox – all powered by Linux web servers
- **Smart Appliances:** [Any smart fridge, oven, or other appliance you own]
- **Other discoveries:** [Any additional Linux-powered device you found]

## 📸 Proof: My Images & Screenshots

Below are the photos and screenshots I took as evidence:

### 1. My Android Smartphone

## 🔗 Research Highlights

During this project, I also looked up specific brands and official sources to confirm Linux use:

- **Android:** Based on official Android documentation, Android is built on the Linux kernel.
- **Routers:** Many routers (including mine) run OpenWRT or DD-WRT, which are Linux-based.
- **Smart TV:** My TV uses Tizen, webOS, or another Linux-based system.
- **Web services:** Popular services like YouTube and Dropbox operate on Linux servers.
- **Other devices:** I consulted manufacturer websites when device settings didn’t specify the OS.

## 💡 What I Learned

This project was an eye-opener! I was surprised to find Linux everywhere from my phone and router to apps and appliances I use daily. Doing this hands-on audit helped me appreciate the practicality and reach of Linux, connecting course theory with real things in my life.

> "It’s fascinating how so many of my devices quietly rely on Linux even when I never see it directly."

## 📁 My Process

1. I identified my daily tech and home devices.
2. I checked “about” screens, device websites, and manuals for Linux references.
3. I took my own photos and screenshots as proof.
4. I summarized my findings, research, and personal reflections here.

This project demonstrates my ability to connect foundational concepts to real-world examples and my curiosity in exploring technology beyond the surface. I look forward to building more hands-on projects as I progress!
