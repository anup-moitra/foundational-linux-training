# Project 01: Linux Around Me

## üìù Objective

As part of my foundational Linux learning journey, I explored and documented where Linux is present in my daily life. This project captures my investigation and observations for **Chapter 1: How We Use Linux Every Day**, connecting course concepts to real-world examples I could find around me.

## üìã Devices & Services I Identified

Here are the devices and services I personally use that rely on Linux:

- **Phone:** Android smartphone ‚Äì runs on the Linux kernel.
- **Home Wi-Fi Router:** Linksys/WRT3200ACM ‚Äì runs on OpenWRT/Linux-based firmware.
- **Smart TV:** Xiaomi/MiTV-AXFR0 ‚Äì runs on Android TV OS (Linux kernel-based).
- **Tablet or eReader:** Amazon Kindle 11th Gen ‚Äì runs on a customized Linux-based OS.
- **Cloud Apps I rely on:** YouTube, Gmail, Dropbox ‚Äì run on Linux web servers.
- **Smart Appliances:** Amazon Echo Spot ‚Äì runs on a customized Linux-based OS, used for Alexa voice interactions, smart home control, and media playback.
- **Extended Setup ‚Äì DIY Smart Display (My Experiment):** I repurposed an old laptop with Chromium OS (the open-source base for Chrome OS, Linux-based), connected to my TV via HDMI. This setup effectively transformed the TV into a smart Linux-powered display, even though the TV itself doesn‚Äôt run Linux natively. This was my own experiment to extend Linux into my living room in a creative way.

## üì∏ Proof: My Images & Screenshots

Below are the photos and screenshots I took as evidence:

### 1. My Android Smartphone

Snapshot showing my phone's 'About' menu with the Android version and Linux kernel information. It indicates that the device is running Linux kernel version 4.14.186, which is commonly used in Android devices.

### 2. My Home Wi-Fi Router

Screenshot of my router‚Äôs admin panel confirming it‚Äôs running OpenWrt 23.05.3, a Linux-based firmware for routers built on Linux kernel version 5.15.150.

### 3. My Smart TV

<img src="images/smart-tv-settings.png" alt="Smart TV settings"/>  
My TV's settings screen shows it runs Android TV OS version 11, which is based on the Android operating system that uses the Linux kernel (version 5.4.125), confirming it is a Linux-based system.

### 4. My Kindle eReader

<img src="images/kindle-about.png" alt="Kindle Device Information"/>  
Snapshot of my Kindle 11th Gen's device information screen. Amazon Kindles run a customized operating system built on the Linux kernel, confirming they are Linux-powered devices.

### 5. My DIY Smart Display Setup

<img src="images/chromiumos-tv.png" alt="Chromium OS on TV via HDMI" width="750"/>  
I installed Chromium OS (the open-source base for Chrome OS, which runs on the Linux kernel) on an old laptop. By connecting it to my TV via HDMI, I effectively turned the TV into a Linux-powered smart display for browsing, streaming, and cloud access. This was an experimental setup I built myself to extend Linux usage at home.

## üîó Research Highlights

During this project, I also looked up specific brands and official sources to confirm Linux use:

- **Android:** Based on [official Android documentation](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel), Android OS is built on the Linux kernel.
- **Routers:** Many routers (including mine) run [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/), which is a Linux-based firmware.
- **Smart TV:** My TV runs Android TV OS, which uses the Linux kernel as its foundation.
- **Kindle:** Amazon Kindle eReaders use a customized Linux-based operating system.
- **Web services:** Popular services like YouTube and Dropbox operate on Linux servers.
- **Chromium OS:** Chromium OS is the open-source version of Chrome OS, both built on the Linux kernel and designed to run lightweight, browser-based systems.

## üí° What I Learned

This project was an eye-opener! I was surprised to find Linux everywhere, from my phone, router, and Kindle to apps and appliances I use daily. Even more interesting was experimenting with my own Linux-powered setup by installing Chromium OS on old hardware. Doing this hands-on audit helped me appreciate the practicality and reach of Linux, connecting course theory with real things in my life.

> "It‚Äôs fascinating how so many of my devices quietly rely on Linux even when I never see it directly."

## üìÅ My Process

1. I identified my daily tech and home devices.
2. I checked ‚Äúabout‚Äù screens, device websites, and manuals for Linux references.
3. I took my own photos and screenshots as proof.
4. I experimented with repurposing old hardware to extend Linux usage at home.
5. I summarized my findings, research, and personal reflections here.

This project demonstrates my ability to connect foundational concepts to real-world examples and my curiosity in exploring technology beyond the surface. I look forward to building more hands-on projects as I progress!
