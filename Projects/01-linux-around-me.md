# Project 01: Linux Around Me

## üìù Objective

As part of my foundational Linux learning journey, I explored and documented where Linux is present in my daily life. This project captures my investigation and observations for **Chapter 1: How We Use Linux Every Day**, connecting course concepts to real-world examples I could find around me.

## üìã Devices & Services I Identified

Here are the devices and services I personally use that rely on Linux:

- **Phone:** Android smartphone ‚Äì runs the Linux kernel
- **Home Wi-Fi Router:** Linksys/WRT3200ACM ‚Äì uses OpenWRT/Linux-based firmware
- **Smart TV:** Xiaomi/MiTV-AXFR0 ‚Äì runs Android TV OS (Linux kernel-based)
- **Tablet or eReader:** Amazon Kindle 11th Gen ‚Äì powered by a customized Linux-based OS
- **Cloud Apps I rely on:** YouTube, Gmail, Dropbox ‚Äì all powered by Linux web servers
- **Smart Appliances:** Amazon Echo Spot ‚Äì this smart speaker runs a customized Linux-based OS, used for Alexa voice interactions, smart home control, and media playback.
- **Extended Setup ‚Äì DIY Smart Display:** Repurposed an old laptop with Chromium OS (open-source Chrome OS, Linux-based), connected to my TV via HDMI. This setup effectively transformed the TV into a smart Linux-powered display, even though the TV itself doesn't run Linux natively.

## üì∏ Proof: My Images & Screenshots

Below are the photos and screenshots I took as evidence:

### 1. My Android Smartphone

Snapshot showing my phone's 'About' menu with the Android version and Linux kernel information. It indicates that the device is running Linux kernel version 4.14.186, which is commonly used in Android devices.

### 2. My Home Wi-Fi Router

Screenshot of my router's admin panel confirming it's running OpenWrt 23.05.3‚Äîa Linux-based firmware for routers, built with Linux kernel version 5.15.150.

### 3. My Smart TV

<img src="images/smart-tv-settings.png" alt="Smart TV settings"/>  
My TV's settings screen shows it runs Android TV OS version 11, which is based on the Android operating system that uses the Linux kernel (version 5.4.125), confirming it is a Linux-based system.

### 4. My Kindle eReader

<img src="images/kindle-about.png" alt="Kindle Device Information"/>  
Screenshot from my Kindle 11th Gen's device information screen. Amazon Kindles run a customized operating system built on the Linux kernel, confirming they are Linux-powered devices.

### 5. My DIY Smart Display Setup

<img src="images/chromiumos-tv.png" alt="Chromium OS on TV via HDMI"/>  
I installed Chromium OS (the open-source base for Chrome OS, which runs on the Linux kernel) on an old laptop. By connecting it to my TV via HDMI, I effectively turned the TV into a Linux-powered smart display for browsing, streaming, and cloud access.

## üîó Research Highlights

During this project, I also looked up specific brands and official sources to confirm Linux use:

- **Android:** Based on official Android documentation, Android OS is built on the Linux kernel.
- **Routers:** Many routers (including mine) run OpenWRT or DD-WRT, which are Linux-based.
- **Smart TV:** My TV runs Android TV OS, which uses the Linux kernel as its foundation.
- **Kindle:** Amazon Kindle eReaders use a customized Linux-based operating system.
- **Web services:** Popular services like YouTube and Dropbox operate on Linux servers.
- **Chromium OS:** Chromium OS is the open-source version of Chrome OS, both built on the Linux kernel and designed to run lightweight, browser-based systems.

## üí° What I Learned

This project was an eye-opener! I was surprised to find Linux everywhere‚Äîfrom my phone, router, and Kindle to apps and appliances I use daily. Even more interesting was experimenting with my own Linux-powered setup by installing Chromium OS on old hardware. Doing this hands-on audit helped me appreciate the practicality and reach of Linux, connecting course theory with real things in my life.

> "It‚Äôs fascinating how so many of my devices quietly rely on Linux even when I never see it directly."

## üìÅ My Process

1. I identified my daily tech and home devices.
2. I checked ‚Äúabout‚Äù screens, device websites, and manuals for Linux references.
3. I took my own photos and screenshots as proof.
4. I even repurposed old hardware to explore Linux usage hands-on.
5. I summarized my findings, research, and personal reflections here.

This project demonstrates my ability to connect foundational concepts to real-world examples and my curiosity in exploring technology beyond the surface. I look forward to building more hands-on projects as I progress!
