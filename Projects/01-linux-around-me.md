# Project 01: Linux Around Me

## üìù Objective  

In this project, I mapped where Linux shows up in the devices and services I use every day. This project supports **Chapter 1: How We Use Linux Every Day** by connecting course concepts to examples around me.  

**Related reading:** [Chapter 1: How We Use Linux Every Day](../01-understanding-linux-concepts/01-everyday-linux.md)  

## üìã Tasks I Performed  

Here are the devices and services I personally use that rely on Linux:  

- **Phone:** Android smartphone that runs on the Linux kernel  
- **Home Wi-Fi Router:** Linksys WRT3200ACM that runs on OpenWrt and a Linux-based firmware  
- **Smart Television:** Xiaomi MiTV AXFR0 that runs on Android TV OS, which is based on the Linux kernel  
- **Tablet or E-Reader:** Amazon Kindle 11th Gen that runs on a customized Linux-based operating system  
- **Cloud Applications I Use:** YouTube, Gmail, and Dropbox, which are widely known to use Linux-based infrastructure  
- **Extended Setup (DIY Smart Display):** I repurposed an old laptop with Chromium OS (the open-source base for Chrome OS, which is Linux-based) and connected it to my television via HDMI. This turned the television into a Linux-powered display even though the device itself does not run Linux natively  

## üì∏ Proof: My Images and Screenshots  

Photos and screenshots are stored under the `images/` folder in the project directory.

## üîó Research Highlights  

- **Android:** Android is built on the Linux kernel. See: <https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel>  
- **Routers:** Many consumer routers run OpenWrt, which is Linux-based: <https://openwrt.org/>  
- **Smart Television:** Android TV OS uses the Linux kernel as its foundation  
- **Kindle:** Amazon Kindle devices run a customized Linux-based operating system  
- **Chromium OS:** Chromium OS is the open-source base for Chrome OS, both built on the Linux kernel and designed for lightweight, browser-focused systems  

## üí° What I Learned  

- Linux shows up in more devices than I expected, from phones to routers and e-readers  
- Even when Linux is hidden behind brand names such as Android or Kindle OS, it is still the underlying core system  
- Repurposing old hardware with Chromium OS helped me see how Linux can extend the life of devices  
- Understanding where Linux runs builds intuition for recognizing it in enterprise infrastructure  
- Knowing these real world examples is useful for interviews and career discussions  

## üìÅ My Process  

1. Listed the devices and services I use daily  
2. Checked About screens, admin panels, and vendor documentation for Linux references  
3. Took photos and screenshots as proof  
4. Built a small experiment by repurposing old hardware with Chromium OS  
5. Summarized the findings, references, and reflections here  

### üèÅ Conclusion  

Linux is everywhere, from my phone and television to my router and e-reader. It even gave new life to old hardware through Chromium OS. By auditing my own environment, I learned that Linux is not abstract or distant, it is part of my everyday technology.  

> üí° **Next Up:**  
> I will look under the hood of my operating system to learn what an operating system does and how Linux manages system resources.
