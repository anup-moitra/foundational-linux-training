# Project 01: Linux Around Me

## 📝 Objective

As part of my foundational Linux learning journey, I explored and documented where Linux is present in my daily life. This project captures my investigation and observations for **Chapter 1: How We Use Linux Every Day**, connecting course concepts to real-world examples I could find around me.

## 📋 Devices & Services I Identified

Here are the devices and services I personally use that rely on Linux:

- **Phone:** Android smartphone – runs the Linux kernel
- **Home Wi-Fi Router:** [Linksys/WRT3200ACM] – uses [OpenWRT/Linux-based firmware if applicable]
- **Smart TV:** [Insert Brand/Model] – powered by Linux-based OS
- **Tablet or eReader:** [Insert Device] – Linux (for example, Kindle eReader)
- **Cloud Apps I rely on:** YouTube, Gmail, Dropbox – all powered by Linux web servers
- **Smart Appliances:** [Any smart fridge, oven, or other appliance you own]
- **Other discoveries:** [Any additional Linux-powered device you found]

## 📸 Proof: My Images & Screenshots

Below are the photos and screenshots I took as evidence:

### 1. My Android Smartphone

Snapshot showing my phone's 'About' menu with the Android version and Linux kernel information. It indicates that the device is running Linux kernel version 4.14.186, which is commonly used in Android devices.

### 2. My Home Wi-Fi Router

Screenshot of my router's admin panel confirming it's running OpenWrt 23.05.3 — a Linux-based firmware designed for routers, with Linux kernel version 5.15.150.

### 3. My Smart TV

## 🔗 Research Highlights

During this project, I also looked up specific brands and official sources to confirm Linux use:

- **Android:** Based on official Android documentation, Android is built on the Linux kernel.
- **Routers:** Many routers (including mine) run OpenWRT or DD-WRT, which are Linux-based.
- **Smart TV:** My TV uses Tizen, webOS, or another Linux-based system.
- **Web services:** Popular services like YouTube and Dropbox operate on Linux servers.
- **Other devices:** I consulted manufacturer websites when device settings didn’t specify the OS.

## 💡 What I Learned

This project was an eye-opener! I was surprised to find Linux everywhere from my phone and router to apps and appliances I use daily. Doing this hands-on audit helped me appreciate the practicality and reach of Linux, connecting course theory with real things in my life.

> "It’s fascinating how so many of my devices quietly rely on Linux even when I never see it directly."

## 📁 My Process

1. I identified my daily tech and home devices.
2. I checked “about” screens, device websites, and manuals for Linux references.
3. I took my own photos and screenshots as proof.
4. I summarized my findings, research, and personal reflections here.

This project demonstrates my ability to connect foundational concepts to real-world examples and my curiosity in exploring technology beyond the surface. I look forward to building more hands-on projects as I progress!
