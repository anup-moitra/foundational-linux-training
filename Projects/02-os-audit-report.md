# Project 02: My OS Audit Report

## 📝 Objective

To build on my understanding of operating systems, I analyzed the various OSes running on my personal devices. This project demonstrates how different device types rely on different operating systems, with a focus on their key functions and why an OS is essential.

## 📋 Devices & OS Analysis

| Device       | Operating System         | OS Type    | Key Functions Handled                  |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Laptop       | Windows 11              | Desktop    | File management, security, multitasking |
| Smartphone   | Android 12              | Mobile     | Touch interface, app management        |
| Tablet       | Fire OS (Android-based) | Mobile     | Media, parental controls               |
| Wi-Fi Router | OpenWRT (Linux)         | Embedded   | Network routing, access control        |
| Smart TV     | Android TV OS           | Embedded   | Media playback, network connectivity   |

## 📝 What I Learned About Each Device

- **Laptop:**  
  The desktop OS manages files, security, multitasking between apps, and gives me a familiar graphical workspace.

- **Smartphone:**  
  The mobile OS offers a touch-friendly UI, app store access, and handles networking and app permissions smoothly.

- **Tablet:**  
  Used mainly for media and reading; its OS builds on mobile concepts and focuses on simplicity and security.

- **Wi-Fi Router:**  
  The embedded OS runs nonstop, making network decisions and managing who can connect — all without a typical desktop UI.

- **Smart TV:**  
  The OS handles streaming, channel access, and network connections for smart features.

## 💡 Reflection: Why is the OS Essential?

If there was no operating system:

- I couldn't launch apps, save or move files, connect my devices, or secure my data.
- Hardware resources would go unmanaged and using the device would be impossible for non-technical users.
- Each device’s OS makes it usable for its intended tasks, whether that’s productive work, entertainment, or communication.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Through this audit, I recognized just how central operating systems are to every part of my digital life. By identifying the OS and its core roles in each of my devices, I now better appreciate the “invisible layer” that lets us work, play, and connect.
