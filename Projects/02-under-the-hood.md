# Project 02: Under the Hood of Your OS

## 📝 Objective

As part of my foundational Linux learning journey, I explored what my operating system reveals about itself using simple, safe, read-only commands. This project connects to **Chapter 2: What Is an Operating System?** and helps link theory to my own system.

## 📋 Commands I Ran

Here are the basic commands I used to peek into my OS:

- `uname -a` → shows kernel version and architecture  
- `cat /etc/os-release` → displays Linux distribution information  
- `df -h` → reports filesystem and available space  

## 📸 Proof: My Images and Screenshots

Screenshots or terminal captures to store under `images/` in the project directory:

1. Output of `uname -a`  
2. Output of `cat /etc/os-release`  
3. Output of `df -h`  

## 🔗 Research Highlights

During this project, I confirmed the meaning of each command and output:

- **uname:** https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/uname-invocation.html  
- **/etc/os-release:** https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html  
- **df:** https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/df-invocation.html  

## 💡 What I Learned

- The kernel and distribution versions are easy to query directly.  
- The OS structure feels less abstract when I can “ask it questions.”  
- Even simple read-only commands show how the OS organizes hardware and files.  

## 📁 My Process

1. Identified a safe Linux environment (VM or personal machine).  
2. Ran read-only commands.  
3. Captured screenshots of the output.  
4. Researched what each field meant.  
5. Summarized findings and reflections here.
