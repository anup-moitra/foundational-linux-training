# Project 02: Under the Hood of Your OS

## üìù Objective

As part of my foundational Linux learning journey, I explored what my operating system reveals about itself using simple, safe, read-only commands. This project connects to **Chapter 2: What Is an Operating System?** and helps link theory to my own system.

**Related reading:** [Chapter 2: What Is an Operating System?](https://github.com/anup-moitra/foundational-linux-training/blob/main/01-understanding-linux-concepts/02-understanding-the-os.md)

## üìã Commands I Ran

Here are the basic commands I used, each tied to a core role of the operating system:

- `uname -a` ‚Üí shows the **kernel**, the OS core that manages CPU, memory, and devices.  

- `cat /etc/os-release` ‚Üí identifies the **distribution**, the user-space tools and environment built around the kernel.  

- `df -h` ‚Üí demonstrates how the OS manages **storage**, showing filesystems and available space.  

*(Optional curiosity)*  

- `uptime` ‚Üí reveals how long the OS has been running.  
- `lsblk` ‚Üí lists block devices (disks and partitions) managed by the OS.  

## üì∏ Proof: My Images and Screenshots

Screenshots showing each command and its output are stored under `images/` in the project directory:  


1. Output of `uname -a`  

   ![uname -a](https://github.com/anup-moitra/foundational-linux-training/blob/main/Projects/images/uname-a.png)  
   *This shows the system is running CentOS Stream 9 with Linux kernel version **5.14.0-601.el9.x86_64**, built on **July 22, 2025**. It is a **64-bit system**, supports multiple CPUs, and uses the **PREEMPT_DYNAMIC** kernel setting.*  



2. Output of `cat /etc/os-release`  

   ![os-release](https://github.com/anup-moitra/foundational-linux-training/blob/main/Projects/images/os-release-info.png)  
   *The OS release information confirms **CentOS Stream 9**, which is closely tied to **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9)**. The file shows fields like `NAME`, `VERSION`, and `ID_LIKE`, which identify the system‚Äôs lineage and support.*  



3. Output of `df -h`  

   ![df -h](https://github.com/anup-moitra/foundational-linux-training/blob/main/Projects/images/disk_usage_df-h.png)  
   *The disk usage report shows the root filesystem `/` is about **40% full** with **11 GB free**, while `/boot` is about **55% full**. Temporary filesystems (`tmpfs`) also appear, used for memory-backed storage.*  



4. (Optional) Output of `uptime` and `lsblk`  

   ![uptime and lsblk](https://github.com/anup-moitra/foundational-linux-training/blob/main/Projects/images/output-uptime-lsblk.png)  
   *The `uptime` command shows the system has been running for **1 hour 24 minutes**, with **3 users logged in** and a low load average. The `lsblk` output lists one 20 GB disk (`sda`) split into partitions: `/boot`, a root volume (`/`), and a swap partition.*  



## üîó Research Highlights

During this project, I confirmed the meaning of each command and output:

- **uname:** https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/uname-invocation.html  
- **/etc/os-release:** https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html  
- **df:** https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/df-invocation.html  
- **uptime:** https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uptime.1.html  
- **lsblk:** https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsblk.8.html  

## üí° What I Learned

- The kernel and distribution versions are easy to query directly.  
- Each command connects to a specific **role of the OS** (kernel, identity, storage).  
- The OS feels less abstract when I can ‚Äúask it questions‚Äù directly.  
- Optional commands (like `uptime` and `lsblk`) show how much more the OS can reveal even without changing anything.  

## üìÅ My Process

1. Identified a safe Linux environment (VM or personal machine).  
2. Ran read-only commands.  
3. Captured screenshots of the output.  
4. Researched what each field meant.  
5. Summarized findings and reflections here.
