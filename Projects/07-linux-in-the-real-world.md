# Project 07: Linux in the Real World

## 📝 Objective  

In this project, I researched how Linux is used in different industries and organizations. This project connects to **Chapter 7: Who Uses Linux?** and demonstrates Linux’s versatility in powering government systems, enterprises, research, and entertainment.  

**Related reading:** [Chapter 7: Who Uses Linux?](../01-understanding-linux-concepts/07-who-uses-linux.md)  

## 📋 Tasks I Performed  

- Chose three industries where Linux is widely used (government, cloud, and media).  
- Selected one organization in each industry.  
- Researched how Linux helps them in terms of stability, scalability, cost, or security.  
- Summarized the findings in notes and a comparison table.  

## 📸 Proof: My Images and Screenshots  

Screenshots and notes are stored under the `images/` folder in the project directory.  

Examples:  
- Screenshot of AWS Linux documentation.  
- Article snippet showing NASA’s use of Linux.  
- Screenshot of Blender on a Linux-based studio workstation.

## 🔗 Research Highlights  

| **Industry**   | **Organization** | **Linux Use Case**                                                                 |  
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Government     | NASA             | Uses Linux in space missions and research systems for reliability and transparency |  
| Cloud/Servers  | Amazon (AWS)     | Offers Amazon Linux and relies on Linux to power most of its cloud infrastructure  |  
| Media/Film     | Pixar            | Runs Linux-based pipelines with tools like RenderMan and Blender for animation     |

## 💡 What I Learned  

- Linux is not confined to personal computers — it is deeply embedded in mission-critical systems worldwide.  
- Cloud providers like AWS could not scale without Linux’s flexibility and cost-effectiveness.  
- Government and research institutions trust Linux because of its openness and security.  
- Media studios use Linux because it integrates well with professional creative tools and custom workflows.  

## 📁 My Process  

1. Identified three industries where Linux is prominent.  
2. Researched one organization per industry.  
3. Collected evidence from documentation, articles, and official websites.  
4. Created a table to compare findings.  
5. Saved screenshots and summarized observations here.
