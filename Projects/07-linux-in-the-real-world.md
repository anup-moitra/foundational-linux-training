# Project 07: Linux in the Real World

## üìù Objective  

In this project, I researched how Linux is used in different industries and organizations. This project connects to **Chapter 7: Who Uses Linux?** and demonstrates Linux‚Äôs versatility in powering government systems, enterprises, research, and entertainment.  

**Related reading:** [Chapter 7: Who Uses Linux?](../01-understanding-linux-concepts/07-who-uses-linux.md)  

## üìã Tasks I Performed  

- Chose three industries where Linux is widely used (government, cloud, and media)  
- Selected one organization in each industry  
- Researched how Linux helps them in terms of stability, scalability, cost, or security  
- Summarized the findings in notes and a comparison table  

## üì∏ Proof: My Images and Screenshots  

Screenshots and notes are stored under the `images/` folder in the project directory.  

1. Screenshot of AWS Linux documentation

## üîó Research Highlights  

| **Industry**   | **Organization** | **Linux Use Case**                                                                 |  
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Government     | NASA             | Uses Linux in space missions and research systems for reliability and transparency |  
| Cloud and Servers | Amazon (AWS)  | Offers Amazon Linux and relies on Linux to power most of its cloud infrastructure  |  
| Media and Film | Pixar            | Runs Linux-based pipelines with tools such as RenderMan and Blender for animation  |

## üí° What I Learned  

- Linux is not confined to personal computers, it is deeply embedded in mission critical systems worldwide  
- Cloud providers such as AWS could not scale without Linux flexibility and cost effectiveness  
- Government and research institutions trust Linux because of its openness and security  
- Media studios use Linux because it integrates well with professional creative tools and custom workflows  
- These real world use cases are important to know for careers in IT, as interviewers often ask where Linux is used in practice  

## üìÅ My Process  

1. Identified three industries where Linux is prominent  
2. Researched one organization per industry  
3. Collected evidence from documentation, articles, and official websites  
4. Created a table to compare findings  
5. Saved screenshots and summarized observations here  

### üèÅ Conclusion  

By exploring Linux in government, cloud, and media, I realized how its reliability and openness make it the foundation for critical industries. This also showed me why Linux knowledge is a valuable career skill that opens many opportunities.  

> üí° **Next Up:**  
> I will compare Linux and Windows to understand their differences, a topic often discussed in interviews and practical system design.
