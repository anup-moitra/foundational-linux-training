# Module 1: Understanding Linux Concepts
## Chapter 3: What Is Linux?

### Introduction

Linux is the kernel, the core program that talks to hardware and keeps everything running safely. Combine the kernel with tools, libraries, and applications, and you have a complete operating system called a distribution.

### What You Will Learn

- What the term Linux means
- Where Linux is used
- How distributions differ and why that matters

### 1. The Layers

```

[Hardware]
```

### 2. Why People Use Linux

- **Reliable:** Good for systems that run for long periods without interruption.
- **Secure:** Strong permission rules help protect files and applications.
- **Free and open source:** Available at no cost and improved by a global community.
- **Flexible:** Runs on phones, laptops, servers, supercomputers, and small devices.
- **Career friendly:** Common in roles such as system administration, cloud, DevOps, and security.

### 3. Where You Will See Linux

- **Servers and cloud**
- **Android phones**
- **Routers and televisions**
- **Raspberry Pi and Internet of Things**

### 4. Distributions in Short

A distribution chooses defaults such as the desktop environment and the package manager.

- Ubuntu and Debian use `apt`
- Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux use `dnf`
- Arch uses `pacman`

### Conclusion

Linux is the kernel at the heart of many systems. Distributions build on it to create complete, ready to use operating systems.
