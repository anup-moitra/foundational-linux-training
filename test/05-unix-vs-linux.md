# Module 1: Understanding Linux Concepts
## Chapter 5: Difference Between Unix and Linux

### Introduction

Unix and Linux share design ideas and command line traditions, but they are not the same system. Understanding how they differ will help you read documentation and choose the right tools.

### What You Will Learn

- What Unix is and where it is used
- What Linux is and how it evolved separately
- Key differences that matter in practice

### 1. What Is Unix

Unix originated at Bell Labs in the 1970s and appears today mostly in legacy enterprise systems. Common variants include Solaris, AIX, and HP UX. macOS is certified as Unix and descends from BSD.

### 2. What Is Linux

Linux began in 1991 as a new kernel inspired by Unix ideas. It is released under the GPL and is available in many distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

### 3. Key Differences

| Feature | Unix | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Origin | 1970s at Bell Labs | 1991 by Linus Torvalds |
| License | Mostly proprietary | Open source under GPL |
| Customization | Vendor controlled | Highly flexible |
| Hardware | Specific platforms | Many architectures |
| User base | Legacy enterprise | Servers, cloud, mobile, embedded |
| Filesystems | Vendor specific | ext4, XFS, Btrfs, ZFS and more |
| Standards | POSIX certified | Largely POSIX compatible |

### 4. Why Linux Dominates Today

Linux is free to obtain, flexible, and supported by a global community. It is the standard in servers, cloud platforms, and supercomputing.

### Conclusion

Unix laid the groundwork. Linux took those ideas and scaled them with open source development.
