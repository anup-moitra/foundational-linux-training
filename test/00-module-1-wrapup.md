## Key Takeaways

- Linux appears in phones, routers, televisions, supercomputers, and cloud servers.
- An operating system manages hardware and software so they cooperate.
- Linux is the kernel at the core of many systems, distributions add user tools.
- Linux history connects UNIX design, the GNU project, and open source licensing.
- Differences between Unix, Linux, and Windows shape professional choices.
- Distributions target different audiences: beginners, enterprises, power users, and specialists.
- Linux powers industries from government and finance to media and research.
- The hands-on comparison with Windows highlights Linux automation and package management.

## Next Steps

You are ready for Module 2, which sets up a virtual lab in VirtualBox. You will install a Linux virtual machine, enable Guest Additions, and try snapshots so you can experiment with confidence.
