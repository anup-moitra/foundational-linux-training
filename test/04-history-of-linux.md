# Module 1: Understanding Linux Concepts
## Chapter 4: History of Linux

### Introduction

Learning where Linux came from explains why it is fast, reliable, and used almost everywhere. This chapter traces the path from UNIX ideas to GNU tools to a kernel that grew into a global platform.

### What You Will Learn

- UNIX influences that shaped Linux
- The GNU project and the missing kernel
- Milestones from 1991 to the present

### 1. UNIX as the Predecessor

UNIX began at AT and T Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It introduced multi user design, a hierarchical file system, and the idea of small tools that work together. It was rewritten in C, so it could move to many kinds of hardware.

### 2. GNU Project

In 1983 the GNU project began, with the goal of building a free UNIX like system. GNU delivered tools such as GCC and Bash, but its own kernel did not become production ready.

### 3. The Birth of Linux

In 1991 Linus Torvalds started a free kernel as a personal project. In 1992 it was released under the GPLv2 license, which allowed anyone to use, modify, and share improvements. Combined with GNU tools, this formed a complete system.

### 4. Growth and Evolution

- 1993, early distributions such as Slackware and Debian simplified installation.
- 1994, Linux 1.0 arrived.
- Late 1990s, companies such as Red Hat and SUSE offered supported distributions.
- 2005, Git was created to manage kernel development.
- 2008, Android brought Linux to smartphones.

### 5. Linux Today

Linux runs on phones, desktops, servers, supercomputers, and embedded devices. It powers cloud platforms and the majority of the Top500 supercomputers.

### Conclusion

Open development, share alike licensing, and a global community turned Linux from a hobby into infrastructure.
